## About the VA.gov project
In November 2018 in an effort to unify Veterans' digital experience, VA began a project to consolidate the hundreds of VA websites, including Vets.gov, under one VA.gov site. As a result, a much improved VA.gov was launched on Veterans Day 2018, serving millions of visitors per month and enabling Veterans to learn about, apply for, and efficiently manage their benefits.

<p>
Every month over 10 million people access the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) digital tools and content. Many of these users have a frustrating experience, encountering a complicated ecosystem of websites, forms, logins, brands, and outdated tools. Additionally, VA is comprised of many legacy systems with varied languages and environments. Every system is different and there is not consistent documentation.
</p>
<p>
This led to the development and launch of Vets.gov in 2015, which delivered a modern digital experience that enabled Veterans to learn about, apply for, and manage their VA benefits efficiently.
