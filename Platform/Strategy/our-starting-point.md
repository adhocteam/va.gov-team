# VSP: Where to next?
This document is a starting point of where, exactly, the platform pivot will take us.

## How we got here

**TL;DR**: We learned a lot building vets/va.gov. We want anyone who wants to build quality veteran-facing services to be able to leverage what we learned.

### The challenges and what we did about them

It's hard to deliver quality veteran-facing services at VA.

First, VA has generally approached the delivery of veteran-facing services in a top-down prescriptive way. Stiff technology and experience requirements are derived from legislative mandates, business needs, political considerations, and — only sometimes — the needs of actual veterans. In the end, the products delivered don't align well with the needs of their veteran users.

 - **What we did about it**: Hired product-minded people and empowered them to focus on user needs to exclusion of all else. Partnered with program offices and OIT to build support for user-centered methodologies. Went to the mat to make sure user needs were prioritized over business needs. 

Second, even if lots of quality user research and discovery is conducted to inform the product, VA's collection of technology systems, infrastructure, and processes will prevent effective delivery. Designing for the needs of veteran users is an excellent start, but if it impossible to meet those needs because of bad technology, the product will also fail to meet veteran needs.

 - **What we did about it**: Built a robust, stable API layer that stands between veterans and existing VA resources to significantly reduce the chances of a veteran being denied services because of a VA system failure. Built processes and toolchains that allow for rapid, flexible development while remaining compliant with VA enterprise rules.

### Can we scale it?

Addressing these challenges created yet another: how do we leverage what we've learned and built so that the delivery of quality veteran-facing services is not constrained by the number of teams DSVA can deploy? Our answer was to start thinking about our body of work as a "platform" that others could leverage to support their own veteran-facing services.

The platform concept took shape as the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) [took shape](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support/background/old-dsva-platform-project-readme.md#background) in spring 2018 with an ambitious mission:

> Empower VA to continue building and launching human-centered, modern tools at scale without significant external support and guidance.

Over the next ten months, several teams piloted the VSP to build tools and services:

 - Ad Hoc, a contractor serving DSVA, built a form following an [early iteration](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs) of the VA Digital Services Handbook (first half 2018)
 - AbleVets, a contractor serving another VA office, added [Community Care locations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Facilities_Locator/community_care) to the existing Facility Locator tool (May 2018 - )
 - Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor serving another VA office, built [multiple benefits forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support/research/pilot-3.md) (July 2018 - )
 - Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor serving another VA office, built a [form for the VET TECH pilot program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Education%20Benefits/0994) (January 2019 - )

The teams, with exception of VET TECH, have provided useful feedback about their VSP experience. More on that in _What we learned_, below.

Concurrently with the pilots, DSVA produced a significant amount of guides and documentation geared towards “external teams” — those teams who were not directly managed by DSVA staff. Items produced included the [VA Digital Services Handbook](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/), an external team focused [Github repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-external-teams), and [instructional material](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support) for DSVA to manage the VSP.

### What we learned

**TL;DR**: It’s really hard to enforce the level of product quality DSVA demands if DSVA is not closely involved with day-to-day product management.

 - Asking non-DSVA managed teams to adhere to DSVA standards but without being there to empower those teams to do so is not fair to the teams and does not result in success. For example, if adherence to DSVA's standards mean that a non-DSVA team will not be able to make externally imposed deadlines and DSVA isn't there to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the team to push back, we're putting that non-DSVA in an impossible situation.
 
 - In a perfect scenario, a non-DSVA team following our Handbook to the letter shouldn't ever need to choose between stakeholder needs and user needs because they will have worked closely with the business owner to develop a clear set of user needs, thoroughly understand the problem based on real research, conducted technical discovery, etc... We know, however, that it is rare that non-DSVA teams have the time and budget to accomplish this before getting started on delivery. And even if time and budget exist, non-DSVA often lack a champion who will push for these critical tasks to be completed.

  
## Where we’re headed

**TL;DR**: Only teams with direct DSVA involvement will use the platform. The platform will be focused on enablement, not governance and quality control.

As discussed above, the original VSP vision was to address both the product and technology challenges of delivering quality veteran-facing services. The Handbook and checkpoint reviews would enforce good, user-centered product development, while the VSP's APIs, security and compliance work, and deep knowledge about VA systems would abstract away technology challenges.

We learned that shouldering the VSP with both of these responsibilities is not effective. Thus, the next iteration of the VSP will focus squarely on only one: overcome difficult but common challenges with VA technology to enable the efficient delivery of high-quality veteran facing services. We will abstract away the painful technology, security, compliance, and bureaucratic barriers so product teams can better focus on the user.

Specifically, the VSP team will be responsible for:

- Exposing VA data resources via APIs
- Platform-level security, compliance, and ATO
- Infrastructure, networking, and routing
- Maintaining a development/orchestration environment
- Maintaining a shared set of engineering assets (e.g. pattern library or SDK)
- Call center support
- Performance monitoring

### ...but what about quality?

If the VSP is focused on enablement, who will make sure the teams that are enabled are actually building quality, user-centered veteran-facing services? Two ways:

- **At the product or feature level**, a DSVA team member will be closely advising, supporting, managing, leading, influencing, nudging, etc... product delivery teams responsible for delivering veteran-facing services.
- **At the the va.gov level**, the forthcoming "va.gov global experience team" will be responsible for setting and enforcing standards for *any* veteran-facing service that is accessible via .va.gov. This [nifty map](team-layout.png) shows how this global team, the VSP, and teams building veteran-facing services all work fit together.

## Success is... 

**TL;DR**: DSVA continuously delivering high quality veteran-facing tools and services in close collaboration with VA business owners, OIT, and contractors. Development teams are able to easily use existing VA.gov assets and resources. Stable projects graduate from DSVA to the relevant OIT product portfolio and line.
