# VSP: Where to next?
This document is a starting point of where, exactly, the platform pivot will take us.

## How we got here

**TL;DR**: We sought to scale the success of vets/va.gov by making it easy for non-DSVA teams to build like us and with us.

The founding vision for the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) [took shape](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support/background/old-dsva-platform-project-readme.md#background) in spring 2018:

> Empower VA to continue building and launching human-centered, modern tools at scale without significant external support and guidance.

A solution like the VSP was needed because DSVA’s limited product development capacity would not meet the high demand for quality tools and services available via Vets.gov. VSP would allow DSVA to scale the know-how and technology that created Vets.gov to other teams within the VA without a linear scaling of DSVA capacity.

Over the next ten months, several teams piloted the VSP to build tools and services:

 - Ad Hoc, a contractor serving DSVA, built a form following an [early iteration](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs) of the VA Digital Services Handbook (first half 2018)
 - AbleVets, a contractor serving another VA office, added [Community Care locations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Facilities_Locator/community_care) to the existing Facility Locator tool (May 2018 - )
 - Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor serving another VA office, built [multiple benefits forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support/research/pilot-3.md) (July 2018 - )
 - Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor serving another VA office, built a [form for the VET TECH pilot program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Education%20Benefits/0994) (January 2019 - )

The teams, with exception of VET TECH, have provided useful feedback about their VSP experience. More on that in _What we learned_, below.

Concurrently with the pilots, DSVA produced a significant amount of guides and documentation geared towards “external teams” — those teams who were not directly managed by DSVA staff. Items produced included the [VA Digital Services Handbook](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/), an external team focused [Github repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-external-teams), and [instructional material](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Work%20Practices/Platform-Support) for DSVA to manage the VSP.

## What we learned

**TL;DR**: It’s really hard to enforce the level of product quality DSVA demands if DSVA is not closely involved with day-to-day product management.

## Where we’re headed

**TL;DR**: Only teams with direct DSVA involvement will use the platform. The platform will be focused on enablement, not governance and quality control. Stable products will be moved out of DSVA.

The VSP team will be responsible for:

- Exposing VA data resources via APIs
- Maintaining a development or orchestration environment
- Maintaining a shared set of design, content, and engineering assets
- Infrastructure, networking, and routing
- Call center support
- Performance monitoring
- Platform-level security and compliance

Governance and quality control for any veteran-facing tool or service that is accessible via va.gov will be executed by the va.gov global experience team. There should be minimal gaps products developed with close DSVA involvement and the expectations of the va.gov global experience team.

## Success is... 

**TL;DR**: DSVA continuously delivering high quality veteran-facing tools and services in close collaboration with VA business owners, OIT, and contractors. Development teams are able to easily use existing VA.gov assets and resources. Stable projects graduate from DSVA to the relevant OIT product portfolio and line.
