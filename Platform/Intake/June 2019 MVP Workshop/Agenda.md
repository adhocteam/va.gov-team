## Reminder about the Epics
As a VFS team, I need to have accurate expectations around what it takes to "launch" and around what support I'll have available, so that I can move forward effectively and incorporate the necessary methods from the beginning (thus avoiding)

## Related Hypothesis
The right balance of friction and ease in intake and onboarding will result in attracting VSA teams empowered to be agile and outcome-driven, and maintain and iterate on their products over time.

## Agenda

**First 50 min**
- Review Service Blueprint
- Identify biggest pain points (both for Teams and VA)
- Rapid write ideas for things that could mitigate those pains at the beginning
- Vote on the things per 2 criteria
  - How well does it drive toward meeting Launch Checklist?
  - How well does it drive toward human-centered / outcome-centered pracices?
- The top 3 things are what we build into MVP

BREAK

**Next 50 min**
- For each of those 3, set up outline

**Last hour**
- Dry run so we know what else to fill in to be ready for Sprint 2
