# Intake / Onboarding MVP Workshop

## Related Epic
As a VFS team, I need to have accurate expectations around what it takes to "launch" and around what support I'll have available, so that I can move forward effectively and incorporate the necessary methods from the beginning (thus avoiding complicated and fustrating code reviews / other reviews.)

## Related Hypothesis
The right balance of friction and ease in intake and onboarding will result in attracting VSA teams empowered to be agile and outcome-driven in their delivery, and maintain and iterate on their products over time.

## Agenda

**First 50 min**
- Review existing intake / onboarding process (10 min)
- Review pain points in Service Blueprint + identify biggest pain points (10 min)
- Rapid write ideas for things we could do in intake/onboarding that might prevent those things from becoming pains later (15 min)
- Vote on the things per 2 criteria (10 min)
  - How well does it drive toward easily meeting Launch Checklist requirements?
  - How well does it drive toward human-centered / outcome-centered pracices?
- Select top 3 to incorporate into MVP (5 min)

BREAK

**Next 50 min**
- Create intake / onboarding process doc
- Outline process incl the 3 "features" from previous activity

BREAK

**Last hour**
- Dry run w/what we have so far
- Assign gaps as ZH issues to wrap up by end of Sprint 1
