### Maslow's Hierarchy of Insights Needs

Start the MVP focused on the bolded items

1. Data: performance
2. Data: usability data
3. **Easy access**
4. **Insights**
5. Data: outcomes data
6. **Adoption**
7. Advocacy

### MVP Approach:

- Test initial MVP in Google Sheets
- (Access) Do design pass so it adheres to design best practices
- (Access) Iterate to ensure 508 Accessibility
- (Insights) What are the thresholds we use for color coding?
- (Insights) Add initial microcopy / glossary / content to explain what these things are
- (Insights) Add Weekly view (since Monthly is probably too long to go w/o knowledge on how something is doing)
- (Insights) pre-populate suggested outcomes data to track that will be blank until known
- Stretch: realtime
- Stretch: populate weekly performance automatically
- Stretch: populate monthly performance automatically

#### Test for these things:
- (Insights) Legend to understand how to turn color indicators into actions
- (Access) link things up to their source

### Post MVP:
- (Adoption) Set up alerts
- (Insights) Measuring iterative development should require baselines + intentional tracking to see if they improve w/iteration
