# Research Plan for Education Analytics MVP -- draft

## Background
Based on a previous Insights and Analytics kickoff meeting, a Product Health prototype was created. We want to test the prototype with product owners and stakeholders to identify gaps and areas that need improvement.  

## Research Questions
1. Can product owners/stakeholders easily identify when products are up or down?
1. When a product owner identifies that a product is down or performing poorly, is the next step clear?
1. Can product owners/stakeholders determine which product needs the most attention?
1. What questions, objectives, and/or key results is the product owner/stakeholder looking for information on when they access analytics?
    - Using the spreadsheet, are they able to confidently find the answers?
    - What will they do with the information next?
1. Do product owners/stakeholders understand metrics like Average Latency, Success/Error Rate, Total/Unique/Repeat Event, and Goal Conversion?
   - Are these the right metrics?
   - Which metrics are missing?
   - Which metrics are not helpful?
   - Are these labels and terms understandable?
1. What do product owners/stakeholders expect to find when they drill in to a data point?
1. Do product owners/stakeholders understand the meanings of the various shades of red and green?
1. What devices do product owners/stakeholders prefer to use to when viewing analytics?
1. What are the expectations/requirements around sharing Insights and Analytics with other team members?
1. What are the expectations/requirements for report date and time range options?
1. How often is data needed? (daily, weekly, monthly)
1. What are the driving forces behind reporting deadlines?

## Hypothesis
TBD


## Method
* We will conduct 45-minute, remote, moderated usability testing using the Product Health spreadsheet/prototype. 
* Sessions will be conducted online using Zoom to record audio from product owners and stakeholders.

## Participants and Recruitment
* Participants must be a VA.gov product owner or stakeholder
* 3-6 participants 
* We will work with the Platform stakeholders to identify participants and schedule sessions

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
TBD

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? 
TBD

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
30 - 45 minutes

4.	Availability: 
TBD

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
TBD
