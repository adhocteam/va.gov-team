# Q3 2019 Sprint 1 Dates
6/27/2019 - 7/9/2019

## Leadership
- Fully update VSP Product Model
- Propose system diagram for connecting objectives, to themes, to epics, to issues
- Collect baseline KRs
- Suggest approach for solving: difficulty knowing how to prioritize and track one-off requests that aren't part of a larger epic, and esure they don't get lost but also don't distract a team from their current focus (unless necessary).
- _Note: this ^ is too much work given that most of it is undere the Product umbrella and Rachael will be OOO a few days this sprint_

## Product Development Support
- Support VFS team product development needs
- Move Product and Design content from `vets.gov-team` repo to `va.gov-team` w/o breaking links and w/o causing massive confusion for VFS teams (RR: should this wait for Ryan L to get back since it's part of the vision he was working on w/Emily?)
- Build out decks/agendas for practice-area-specific kickoffs

## Insights & Analytics Support
- Support VFS team analytics needs
- Deploy iteration of MVP Product Scorecard per user research findings
- Start regular/proceduralized collection of available contact center data

## Content & IA Support
- Support VFS team content & IA needs
- Answer the question: what documentation should I store where? (vets.gov-team, va.gov-team, vfs-teams, etc)
- Roadmap

## Tools & Improvements (1-2 too many objectives currently)
- (Code isolation / best practices) Finish MVP starter app (with generator) for VFS teams
- (Code isolation / best practices) Evaluating feature flag frameworks
- Start implementation on automated banner for DS Logon outage
- SLOs MVP: move into GitHub as formal advice
- (Discovery) Vet360 identity API changes and any potential needs on our end
- *(Stretch)* MVP of Status page for VA.gov stakeholders ([epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/16757), [issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/341))
- _Note: This is too much work for one sprint. We need DSVA to choose some thing(s) to deprioritize.

## Triage
- Improve application error metrics
    - Get FE & BE application errors more integrated with existing on-call infrastructure & procedures
- Answer these questions: What are the communication channels we have access to for updates about the systems/APIs/services VA.gov and VSP depend on? How do we find out about issues, dependency upgrades, planned downtime?

## Operations
- Support VFS team operations needs
- Answer this question: what are the risks w/an open source repo, and how do we handle? What kinds of info should we not store in the public repo, and where should we store it instead?
- Finish determining LOE and timing of CMS infra/ops transition
- Port remaining epics to `va.gov-team`
- Access models for CMS infrastructure move
- Coninue VAEC migration (moving Jenkins, tearing down old infrastructure)
- Define permission model for AWS and Terraform (currently it's mostly "admin or nothing". Want to look into IAM groups.)
- _Note: This is too much work for one sprint. We need DSVA to choose some thing(s) to deprioritize.
