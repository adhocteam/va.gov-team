Q3 2019 Sprint 1 Dates
6/27/2019 - 7/9/2019

Leadership
Fully update VSP Product Model
Propose system diagram for connecting objectives, to themes, to epics, to issues
*** Please deprioritize this. Finishing the product model - especially the Status & Backlog tab - should get most of what we need, and we can re-examine this need for next sprint.
Collect baseline KRs
Suggest approach for solving: difficulty knowing how to prioritize and track one-off requests that aren't part of a larger epic, and esure they don't get lost but also don't distract a team from their current focus (unless necessary).
*** Please stick with the approach discussed in our tues mtg (use #platform-leads) for now and see how that works.
Note: this ^ is too much work given that most of it is undere the Product umbrella and Rachael will be OOO a few days this sprint. What one item should we deprioritize?
Product Development Support
Support VFS team product development needs
Move Product and Design content from vets.gov-team repo to va.gov-team w/o breaking links and w/o causing massive confusion for VFS teams (RR: should this wait for Ryan L to get back since it's part of the vision he was working on w/Emily?)
*** I think some discovery is necessary here, particularly to develop guidelines and address some questions raised by the team around security and design research/PII, how/if to handle engagement from the public, and other general uneasiness. I believe these will be straightforward to resolve, possibly by leaning on policies developed by teams like 18F and cloud.gov, but require some discovery and conversations with the team. I could help Emily with this - update: I see this is also in the content/IA team. (Leah)
Build out decks/agendas for practice-area-specific kickoffs in anticipation of incoming apps teams.
*** Not sure if we should add something for this team, since we're pausing on the repo move. This looks good, and the extra bandwidth could go into extra work on the onboarding decks/agendas. Once sprint starts, I'd like to sync with Emily to understand our current state and this work in a little more detail -- as well as some Lauren/Design transition questions. (Leah)
Insights & Analytics Support
Support VFS team analytics needs
Deploy iteration of MVP Product Scorecard per user research findings
Start regular/proceduralized collection of available contact center data
*** Please add 'start discovery to add Foresee to the MVP Product Scorecard'. This should be small, as the team just got access to the data, but I don't want to detract from contact center work.
Content & IA Support
Support VFS team content & IA needs
Answer the question: what documentation should I store where? (vets.gov-team, va.gov-team, vfs-teams, etc)
Roadmap
Tools & Improvements (1-2 too many objectives currently)
(Code isolation / best practices) Finish MVP starter app (with generator) for VFS teams
(Code isolation / best practices) Evaluating feature flag frameworks
Start implementation on automated banner for DS Logon outage
SLOs MVP: move into GitHub as formal advice
*** these are in good shape, just need to be cleaned up and published. we can take it off this sprint and DSVA (PB is happy to be responsible for it) will handle.
(Discovery) Vet360 identity API changes and any potential needs on our end (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/325)
*** the issue suggests that no changes will be needed on our end. maybe we remove this one from S3 and have DSVA (PB can take the lead) dig a little more? if we do need to update our integration, weâ€™ll have at least 1.5 sprints to get it done.
(Stretch) MVP of Status page for VA.gov stakeholders (epic, issue)
Note: This is too much work for one sprint. We need DSVA to choose some things to deprioritize.
Triage
Improve application error metrics
Get FE & BE application errors more integrated with existing on-call infrastructure & procedures
Answer these questions: What are the communication channels we have access to for updates about the systems/APIs/services VA.gov and VSP depend on? How do we find out about issues, dependency upgrades, planned downtime?
Operations
Support VFS team operations needs (including CMS)
Reframe risks with issues in public repos with proposal for DSVA to analyze
Finish determining LOE and timing of CMS infra/ops transition
Port remaining epics to va.gov-team
*** Dependent on discovery work on public/private repo guidance
Access models for CMS infrastructure move
Coninue VAEC migration (moving Jenkins, tearing down old infrastructure)
Define permission model for AWS and Terraform (currently it's mostly "admin or nothing". Want to look into IAM groups.)
Note: This is too much work for one sprint. We need DSVA to choose some things to deprioritize.
Continue VAEC migration (moving Jenkins, tearing down old infrastructure)
Define permission model for AWS and Terraform (currently it's mostly "admin or nothing". Want to look into IAM groups. Prerequisite for CMS Infrastructure move.)
