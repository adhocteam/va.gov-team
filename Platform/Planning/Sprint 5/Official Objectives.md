### Meta
- tie sprint objectives to epic(s) and/or increase verbosity to make sure we have shared consciousness about what we're planning

### Ideas
- Drop in the PR numbers somewhere (where?) for code reviews we provided support on, so we can sense the volume over time
- ~Post mortem of the July 3 last minute deploy request~
- Evaluate the [VA DevOps Release Process](https://vaww.oit.va.gov/oit/devops/release-process/) - is this something we want to get involved in? Would it save us/someone time and headache on compliance-y things?
- BAH is planning a launch of new GI Bill Comparison Tool functionality and/or content for 8/1. How can we plan this sprint to help _not_ have happen what happened on July 3rd?
  - 7/16 update: Ryan L. and Andrea W. met w/ BAH to start planning product dev. support around 8/1
- Identify and empower product owner for VA Design System.
  - Some [context](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20System/design-system-summary.md)
- Tools: Discovery around single/limited page deploys or other strategies to address lots of concurrent updates (e.g. lots of status updates on lots of different facilities pages). See https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CJ34D8TPB/p1563293514010500.
- Onboard a bunch of VSA teams
- ROE for code reviews per feedback from eng leads
