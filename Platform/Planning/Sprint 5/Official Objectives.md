## General Notes

### Meta
- tie sprint objectives to epic(s) and/or increase verbosity to make sure we have shared consciousness about what we're planning
- after s5 planning, if there are ideas that are still valid in this doc, copy them forward to the nascent s6 objectives

### Unfinished from prior sprint
- ...

### Ideas for new work
- Deploy supporting documentation for MVP starter app (with generator) for VFS teams
- Drop in the PR numbers somewhere (where?) for code reviews we provided support on, so we can sense the volume over time
- ~Post mortem of the July 3 last minute deploy request~
    - \[gunsch\] note: this was written during S4, maybe take some AIs from it for S5?
- Evaluate the [VA DevOps Release Process](https://vaww.oit.va.gov/oit/devops/release-process/) - is this something we want to get involved in? Would it save us/someone time and headache on compliance-y things?
- BAH is planning a launch of new GI Bill Comparison Tool functionality and/or content for 8/1. How can we plan this sprint to help _not_ have happen what happened on July 3rd?
  - 7/16 update: Ryan L. and Andrea W. met w/ BAH to start planning product dev. support around 8/1
- Identify and empower product owner for VA Design System.
  - Some [context](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20System/design-system-summary.md)
- Tools: Discovery around single/limited page deploys or other strategies to address lots of concurrent updates (e.g. lots of status updates on lots of different facilities pages). See https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CJ34D8TPB/p1563293514010500.
- Onboard a bunch of VSA teams
- ROE for code reviews per feedback from eng leads
- CMS FE build improvements (specifics TBD, teams are meeting on 7/23)
- Rationalize / clean up load testing process
- ROE for Slack access - who gets added to DSVA Slack, based on what criteria / verification, and as what account type? Guidence on best practices? Related: are there Slack-specific security concerns (in light of 2015 Slack hack) that we need to look into?
