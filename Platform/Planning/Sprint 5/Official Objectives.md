Ideas:
- Drop in the PR numbers somewhere (where?) for code reviews we provided support on, so we can sense the volume over time
- Post mortem of the July 3 last minute deploy request
- Evaluate the [VA DevOps Release Process](https://vaww.oit.va.gov/oit/devops/release-process/) - is this something we want to get involved in? Would it save us/someone time and headache on compliance-y things?
- BAH is planning a launch of new GI Bill Comparison Tool functionality and/or content for 8/1. How can we plan this sprint to help _not_ have happen what happened on July 3rd?
- Identify and empower product owner for VA Design System
