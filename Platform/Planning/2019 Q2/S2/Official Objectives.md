## Notes from S2 collab session:

Potential S2 objective, NOW/NEXT/FUTURE for all VFS teams we support and who's coming soon (i.e. next and future) and keep it public, and way to track them so we can anticipate their needs and plan ahead. Also helps Leah w/top cover when ppl ask for new things, so we know current volume we're supporting.

Potential S2 objective, have baselines for current status wrt KRs

Potential S2 objective, roadmap for all other VSP teams

Potential S2 objective, align on / agree on / groom on high level NEXT and FUTURE roadmap items w/DSVA

Potential S2 objective, align on plan for handling VSA coming on board

Potential S2 objective, what's the LOE / what would it look like to implement ["Automatically deploy/remove DS Logon outage banner"](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/180)

Insignia onboarding is S3 or later

For CMS - need to figure out what LOE will be needed to support this once CMS team is gone. It will be wrapping the CMS build/release/deploy process into our process (off of their infra into ours). Need Discovery about what "transition" is and what it isn't, and what ops will look like. As of Oct 1 we need to be ready to take over the parts of CMS that we will be taking over (those parts TBD via Discovery). Decision: w/Wyatt on vacation, we may want to wait unil S3.
