# [DRAFT AGENDAS]

## Overall Team Kickoff Agenda

- Welcome! (Intros)
- We're here to help w/ tooling and support teams
- Documentation overview (how to access stuff, where to go for what)
- VSP is a product too, and as such we're always iterating! (i.e. give us your feedback on things that are challenging or not working well, and also expect to get user feedback surveys every once in a while)
- What to expect (launch criteria, documentation best practices)
- Collaborate! (practice area slack channels and meetings)
