# Notes from initial discussion with Patrick, Leah & Rachael 2/21/19 
1. Talk with each of the team to ensure we have a full list of systems/features they use to build stuff
2. Figuring out the user groups for the documentation
3. Sources of documentation (Github Repos, design.va.gov, etc.)
4. Discovery on modular Holistic view of IA for documentation across the board
   - How can we put together an approach for documentation that keeps docs close to code, is open and serves the needs of the various groups.(Mikki for recommendations on activities to do)


 Could a non ad hoc person run this?

Getting perspective from the teams on what they consider the things that people use to build tools. To add to list in  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLx2hZBFjxxtQHcCJPpZpo8j5NgHSqt_joGxXjdV2Y8/edit#gid=0 column D.
