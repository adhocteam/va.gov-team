# Onboarding welcome email template
Subject: Welcome to the Veteran Services Platform (VSP)! Let’s get started.

Welcome to VSP! Our main goal is to provide you with tools and guidance to build the best possible web experience for our country’s Veterans. We’re happy to have you contributing to the project and are looking forward to working with you.

As you develop your application, we’ll be your support team helping you through the VA.gov ecosystem, best practices, and processes - including the iterative cycle of ideation and strategy, user testing, launching code, and measuring results. In the next few days, we’ll meet with you to go over all the resources you’ll need as you develop on VA.gov.

We’re constantly iterating on our VSP tooling and processes to best serve you. This means we’ll be trying out new ideas with you from time to time and always love feedback on what you like, what’s confusing, and what’s missing.

Here’s how to get started:

**1. Attend VSP Onboarding!**

* General onboarding: Wednesday, July 17 at 10:00am ET, [Zoom meeting]()
* Engineering onboarding: Wednesday, July 17 at 12pm ET, [Zoom meeting]() 
* Design onboarding: Wednesday, July 17 at 2pm ET, [Zoom meeting]() 

(We’ll send you calendar invitations for these too once we have email addresses for your full team.)

**2. Have one person on your team complete the following questionnaire** so we can better understand your project, your team, and the best way we might help you: [https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/intake-team]()

Aside from that, be on the lookout for more emails with invitations to our systems (like Slack and GitHub) and collaboration meetings. And get excited - you’re about to embark upon a journey creating solutions that will improve Veterans’ lives. 

We are looking forward to getting started. Welcome to the VA.gov and VSP team.
