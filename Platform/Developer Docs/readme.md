## Problem Statment
The Frontend documentation for VA.gov is spread out and difficult to navigate. As a Veteran Facing Services *(VFS)* frontend developer, I need to be able to access the appropriate infomation for building and updating the VA.gov Platform frontend code without support from the current VA.gov development team.
