# Step One: Discover an issue
We have automated ways of discovering problems throughout the VA.gov ecoysystem via Pager Duty notifications in our `#on-call` DSVA Slack channel and directly to the on-call person. (Read more about [on-call approach and rotation](#).)

We also monitor reports of issues from folks (i.e. VFS Teams and VA Stakeholders) who notice them and report them in the `#triage` DSVA Slack channel.

We would like to be monitoring user-reported issues as well, but our access to that data at this time is extremely limited, so that's something we'll be working on getting better access to.
