## MVP
- Continuation of status quo process
- Documentation of that process and Triage team responsibilities
  - Perform actual triaging of incoming issues
  - Iterate on their process and tooling to make Triage more effecrive
- A few adjustments by June 12:
  - Include current on-call approach in Triage documentation
  - Include in process/responsibilities that Triage is owner of monitoring, prioritizing, shepherding all things Sentry
  - What are the definitions of the Tiers 1, 2, and 3 and what constitutes a handoff from one to the next? (MVP)
  - How can we share expected impact and resolution w/wide audience of stakeholders? (MVP)
  
The Triage MVP will "kick off" (in quotes bc it's a continuation of the existing process) on June 12, 2019, and will start iteration activities on the most critical gaps/problems around the end of June, 2019.
