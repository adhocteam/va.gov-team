## Overview of the White House Hotline

The White House Hotline (WHH) is a call center managed out of the Veterans Experience Office that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It opened in September 2017 with the mission of providing veterans a resource they could contact at any time to assist with any VA-related issue, particularly complaints. The WHH is made up of over 60 agents, that are comprised of both contract and VA employees. The WHH has its own number (enter it here) but also receives any calls coming through the My VA311 IVR. The WHH categorizes calls as complaint or non-complaint and follows a specific process for handling complaints. Non-complaint calls are typically handled by identifying the correct call center to answer a particular question or issue. 

## The Problem

Since the launch of the new VA.gov, there has not been a single call center that is responsible for handling VA.gov user issues due to HRC’s decision to not transition support from Vets.gov to VA.gov.  Because of this, there are several VA.gov specific issues (i.e. signing in, navigation, VA.gov technical issues, etc.) that are not handled or tracked by any call center. This has caused significant problems for the VA.gov team and its users.
1.	Users are unable to get help for simple issues when they call into a call center. Users are being transferred from one call center to another and are unable to find the answers to issues or report a technical problem.
2.	 The VA.gov team(s) are not able to get consistent tracking and feedback on user issues. This has made it nearly impossible to resolve technical issues and has removed the feedback loop of reporting into product development and prioritization. 
To meet the gaps in the current situation, VEO identified the White House Hotline (WHH) as the call center to be trained on VA.gov issues and collaborate with the DSVA and VA.gov teams to create a system for reporting and tracking.  

## Goals of the Trip
1.	Provide training on VA.gov to all agents at the WHH.  We trained 60 agents and supervisors in 12 training sessions.  
2.	Learn more about the operations of the call center. Mina and Alex participated in agent ride alongs… 
3.	Identify gaps that exist that prevent collaboration on metrics and escalation 

## Major Findings and Next Steps
1.	**WHH agents and supervisors are generally not familiar with VA.gov and its offerings.** While we did not poll ahead of the training, we found that many WHH agents, if not the majority, were not intimately familiar with VA.gov and therefore rarely help users with a VA.gov issue. Unsurprisingly, WHH agents who were also veterans, had the most understanding of VA.gov. Otherwise, an agent’s knowledge on VA.gov was completely dependent on their own desire to learn more about it. This is difficult for non-veteran agents because they can’t easily see what an identity verified, veteran account looks like. 

    * Continue providing training and materials to the WHH so they continue to learn and become more comfortable using VA.gov. 

    * We need to create more material and in fact, create a curriculum for getting someone trained up on VA.gov. 

    * Provide access to test accounts so WHH agents can spend time using the site and be able to help direct a user if they are encountering or issue or having trouble navigating.

2.	**Certain WHH policies conflict with agent’s ability to provide VA.gov Tier 1 support.**  The WHH was created to handle escalated cases and complaints. Because of this, the WHH prioritized hiring agents with strong communication skills and empathy. Most agents do not have any experience in handling technical issues, and many of them are not comfortable with using digital tools. Additionally, the WHH does not use scripts to allow agent to converse with a user in a natural way. This makes sense but might not be the best policy when dealing with known, recurring issues. 
    * Focused training on how to troubleshoot technical issues and how to identify issues that should be escalated to the triage team.
    * Work with the WHH Operations team to see if we can find ways to integrate scripted language to help agents feel more comfortable and quickly answer known, recurring VA.gov issues.
    
3.	**It could be a while before we can get WHH analytics that track VA.gov issues in a meaningful way.** The WHH currently uses Salesforce as its CRM. The plan was to transition over to MS Dynamics this summer but this plan has been put on hold due to the need to expand to handle VA.gov and Mission Act issues. This is problematic because currently, all development on Salesforce has been paused which means that changes to fields can’t take place until this pause has been lifted. 
    * We have identified a work around given these constraints, that utilizes pre-existing fields and manually entered phrases. This is less than ideal from a data and agent experience perspective. While we can try and make this work in the very short-term, the goal will be to push the WHH to decide either way (transition to MS Dynamics or resume work on Salesforce). 
    * Given the difficulty of tracking VA.gov issues, we want to try and improve feedback to the VA.gov teams by setting up a consistent listening session. This will allow VA.gov team members to listen to live or pre-recorded calls related to VA.gov and gain insights into the user and agent experience. 
    
4.	**We have found a process for WHH agents to escalate issues to the triage team**

5.	**The VA.gov team will likely have to take a hands on approach in the near term to ensure that the WHH is handling and tracking VA.gov issues in a way that helps us achieve our own goals.** 
    * Develop a process to train the trainer that empowers supervisors and WHH operational staff to take ownership of future VA.gov trainings and the ability to create knowledge articles and scripts based off VA.gov product guides and demo videos. 
    
6.	**Clarity on VA.gov issues will require doing outreach and training at the other major call centers.** 
    * WHH is still sending people to the Vets.gov helpdesk and they are in turn saying they can’t help the veteran  855-574-7286

## Feedback and Questions from WHH Agents
We received a great deal of anecdotal and qualitative information and feedback from the WHH agents as we held trainings. 

* **Facility Locator:** In nearly every training session, multiple agents would complain about the facility locator on VA.gov. Many agents complained that this tool was not helpful to them and in fact, most agents said they used the “interactive” VISN map to help a veteran find the nearest VA Medical Center (https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/map.asp?dnum=1). They did say that the facility locator was useful for community care but even still, they complained a great deal that the information was not complete. From a UI perspective, agents seemed to dislike how the information is displayed. The inability to see a full list was bothersome to them. 
* **DD214:** Agents often asked whether VA.gov provided an easier way for a veteran to request their DD214. They said this was a question that came up constantly and 
* **ID.me Feedback:**
    * Agents expressed a great deal of frustration and distrust with ID.me. They said users who they spoke to often complained about receiving spam from ID.me or were annoyed that they were being forced to upgrade their account with ID.me. We were able to confirm that ID.me does not present the option for signing up for marketing offers during the VA.gov account creation process. It seems some users are still accidentally getting them, perhaps if they sign into their ID.me wallet. 
    * Agents were also frustrated that ID.me didn’t have a posted response time for the helpdesk and that a phone number was provided but did not seem to be the fastest way to get support. We have reached out to ID.me to learn more about their plans for customer support, and get a more concrete estimate for response time. 
* **VA.gov Search Bar:** Agents complained about the search bar and that its search results were not helpful. This is especially problematic because the agents have been instructed to not use google when searching for answers. Agents demonstrated a number of scenarios where they’ve tried to use the search bar to find something very specific and the search bar results were way off.
