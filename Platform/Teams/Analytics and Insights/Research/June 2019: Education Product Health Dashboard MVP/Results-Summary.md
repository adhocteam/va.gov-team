# Results Summary
Based on a previous Insights and Analytics kickoff meeting, a Product Health prototype was created in Google Sheets. We wanted to test the prototype with product owners and stakeholders to identify gaps and areas that need improvement.  

## Research Questions
1. Can product owners/stakeholders easily identify when products are up or down?
1. When a product owner identifies that a product is down or performing poorly, is the next step clear?
   * If able to drill down, what do product owners expect to find?
1. Where do product owners/stakeholders think they can interact (drill down) in the prototype? 
   * Where do they want to be able to drill down? 
   * What do they expect to see when they drill down?
1. Can product owners/stakeholders determine which product needs the most attention?
   * Do product owners/stakeholders understand the meanings of the various shades of red and green?
1. What questions, objectives, and/or key results is the product owner/stakeholder looking for information on when they access analytics?
    - Using the spreadsheet, are they able to confidently find the answers?
    - What will they do with the information next?
1. Do product owners/stakeholders understand metrics like Average Latency, Success/Error Rate, Total/Unique/Repeat Event, and Goal Conversion?
   - Are these the right metrics?
   - Which metrics are missing?
   - Which metrics are not helpful?
   - Are these labels and terms understandable?
1. What devices do product owners/stakeholders prefer to use to when viewing analytics?
1. What are the expectations/requirements around sharing Insights and Analytics with other team members?
1. What are the report timing expectations/requirements?
   * What are the expectations/requirements for report date and time range options?
   * How often is data needed? (daily, weekly, monthly)
   * What are the driving forces behind reporting deadlines?

## Hypothesis
Product owners and stakeholders are able to understand the health status of their products. They are able to drill down to find deeper insights so that they can address issues.
