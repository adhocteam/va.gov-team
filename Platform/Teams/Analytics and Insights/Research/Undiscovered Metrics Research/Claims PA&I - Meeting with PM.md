## Meeting with Claims PM - 6/27/19

**3 Data Streams**
- PA&I Data: Outcomes Stream
- Error Reporting from Internal Sources
- Google Analytics

_Information Funnel for PA&I Data:_ Speak to Claims Product Owner
  - It's been a difficult process and will take some time - data aggregation is very manual and high effort for the contacted group
  - Continuous biweekly emails from the Claims product team. Individually maintained by the Product Owner.
  
**Received Data**
- Form: 2 pages of charts in PDF
- Data:
  - Paper submissions by month
  - Claims Cycle by Source (Avg. Days in Cycle)
  - Pending Claims by Month
  - Avg. Days to Complete
  - Completed Claims
  - Development Items Requested for completed claims
  
**Data Aggregation**

_Difficulties_
  - Data is not a 1:1 comparison to internal metrics
  - To read the data, should understand that all the use cases of paper and eBenefits are not currently supported by va.gov
  - Would be more helpful in product decision making to have this data in the beginning of builds
  
_Helpful_
  - Data supports hypotheses from beginning of Claims build
      - Data supports that the personalized form process helps cut down on claims cycle time
  - Data supports assumption that supports the assumption that va.gov saves VA money and improves the Veteran experience (shoretened cycle time)
  - Data supports product decision to continue building to support more use cases on the Claims app
