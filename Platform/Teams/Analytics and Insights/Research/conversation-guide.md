## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Layla and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the initial prototype for the Education Product Health Analytics dashboard. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of product owners. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

## Get comfortable on the machine
* Okay. I'm going to give you control of my laptop and ask you to complete a few tasks.

*Start screen recording using Zoom.*

## First task: React to Education Product Health Analytics dashboard

    * Why or why not?
    * Go ahead and try.
    * Was that what you expected to find? Why or why not?
