# Call Center Lead Mission:

Improve the Veteran experience on Va.gov by...

1) Empowering Contact Centers to better support the Veterans who call in
2) Ensuring resolution of VA.gov issues reported to us by Contact Centers
2) Incorporating data from Contact Centers into the insights reports, so VFS Teams can better understand challenge areas on the site and can use that info in their product decision-making

*There are a LOT of opportunities we could lean into as ways to improve the incorporation of call centers into the VSP and VA.gov landscapes, and these opportunities will require collaboration across many VSP and VFS teams. Given this complexity (the blue sky scope, and multi-team collaboration), it's critical for the Call Center Lead to provide proactive recommendations around what activities to prioritise and deprioritise from quarter to quarter and sprint to sprint, and to collaborate closely with VSP Leadership to align on that prioritisation.*
