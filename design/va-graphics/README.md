# VA Graphics Standards and Assets

The VA graphics standards guide and graphic assets come from https://vaww.va.gov/6102/index.asp (you must be on the VA network with a PIV card to access). While much of these standards are outdated and mostly for a print world, many of the rules still apply for web.
