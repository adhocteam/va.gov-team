# VA.gov Home Page Design Options

## A. By benefit category

**What:** A home page organized by the 10 benefit categories.

**Working designs:**
* Wireframe: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/blob/master/projects/Merger/design/vadotgov-homepage/design-files/A_benefit-category-home-page%20(1).png>

**Pros:**
* Is administration-agnostic
* Aligns directly with hub-and-spoke content model (i.e., each benefit category is a hub)
* Top tools and services available for each benefit are co-located in *one* list/card
* Orders top benefit categories
* Does not emphasize benefit lifecycle -- most benefit categories do not have tools and services for the *entire* benefit lifycycle (i.e., 'Explore, Apply, Track, Manage')

**Cons:**
* Users will have to do more work to find top tasks within each benefit category
* It may take more clicks to get to what users want
* Does not have a natural home for edge-case content (i.e., stuff that doesn't neatly fit into one of the benefit categories)

**Assumptions:**
* Users' mental models are based on benefit category
* Users will want to explore options on their own vs. being given top tasks
* Focuses on new users who want to primarily explore and apply (not track and manage)

## B. By top tasks

**What:** A home page organized by the top tasks that users are looking for.

**Working design:**
* Wireframe: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/blob/master/projects/Merger/design/vadotgov-homepage/design-files/B_By-top-tasks-home-page%20(2).png>

**Pros:**
* Is administration-agnostic
* Users get to what they want in one or two clicks
* Prioritizes 'Track and Manage' tasks -- the most frequently used tools and services
* Has space for MyHealtheVet and eBenefits log in links/buttons (if single log in is not yet ready)
* Does not emphasize benefit lifecycle -- most benefit categories do not have tools and services for the entire benefit lifycycle (i.e., 'Explore, Apply, Track, Manage')

**Cons:**
* De-emphasizes 'Explore and Apply'
* De-emphasizes benefit categories
* Tasks are not grounded to the content model -- users flows are all over the place (i.e., link to a log in page on MyHealtheVet)

**Assumptions:**
* Users' mental models are based on what they want to do (i.e., task-based), not the benefit category
* Focuses on returning users who want to primarily track and manage (not explore and apply)
