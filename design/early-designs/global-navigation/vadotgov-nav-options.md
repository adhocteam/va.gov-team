# VA.gov Navigation Options

## A. By benefit lifecycle

**What:** A global navigation organized by the benefit lifecycle ('Explore, Apply, Track, Manage').

**Working designs:**
* Wireframe: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/tree/master/projects/Merger/design/global-navigation/design-files/A-benefit-lifecycle-nav>

**Pros:**
* Is administration-agnostic
* Is task-based
* Clearly delineates between unauthenticated ('Explore and Apply') and authenticated ('Track and Manage') content
* Focuses on both types of users: (1) new or returning users who want to learn about benefits and apply for a benefit for the first time and (2) returning users who want to track and manage their existing benefits

**Cons:**
* Assumes users have one authenticated account experience with all of their health and benefits info in one place
* Focuses on transactional tools and services over learning resources

**Assumptions:**
* Users' mental models are based on what they want to do (i.e., task-based), not the benefit category

## B. By benefit category

**What:** A global navigation organized by the 10 benefit categories.

**Working design:**
* Wireframe: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/tree/master/projects/Merger/design/global-navigation/design-files/B-benefit-category-nav>

**Pros:**
* Is administration-agnostic
* All benefit lifecycle content is co-located in one list/menu

**Cons:**
* Users will have to do more work to find top tasks within each benefit category
* It may take more clicks to get to what users want
* Does not have a natural home for edge-case content (i.e., stuff that doesn't neatly fit into one of the benefit categories)

**Assumptions:**
* Users' mental models are based on benefit category
