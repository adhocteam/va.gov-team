## Goal
Understand how Veterans organize the "other" resources that do not fit neatly into the service oriented buckets (like disability, housing, etc.). Examples of these resources include Veteran ID card and Welcome Kit).

### Research Questions
- Do we need to create additional benefit categories?
- How do we treat edge case content/audience based content?
- What labels work for these resources?

## Format
Open Card Sort, Digital, Unmoderated

## Recruiting
Social Media through Natalie, MHV mailing list (hopefully Chip buys in)

## Participants
- Primary: Veterans
- Secondary: Family Member, Caregiver, VSO Representative, Current Servicemember

## Timeline
Study Plan: April 2-6
