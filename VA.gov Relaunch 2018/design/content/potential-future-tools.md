| [About VA disability ratings](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/about-disability-ratings/) | Combined ratings calculator | [Calculator in development](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/18214). Noting here just to keep everything together. |
| [2019 VA disability compensation rates](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/) and sub pages | Rate wizard | Wizard that allows Veteran to input information/answer questions about: <ul><li> Disability rating/combined rating (bring in rating calculator?)</li><li>Details around loss of limbs or other serious disability that may make the Veteran eligibility for [special monthly compensation](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/)</li> <li>Number and type of dependents (spouse, child(ren), parent(s))</li><li>Added benefits (Aid and Attendance/Housebound allowance) for Veteran and/or spouse</li><li>Whether they're receiving military retirement pay, disability severance pay,or separation pay</li><li>Whether they're incarcerated for a felony (noting, but may want to leave out)</li><li>Whether they received a Medal of Honor</li><li>Inputs/questions to identify automobile and/or clothing allowance or birth defect compensation</li></ul> <br> We've organized this information, and added contextual instructions where relevant, to make it much easier to find one's rates. But a wizard that brings all of the different rates together could really help simplify the experience even further. Or, if it's not possible to bring everything together, even a wizard that brings together [the basics around rating/dependents/A&A](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/) and/or a wizard for [special monthly compensation](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/) could be very helpful.| <ul><li>[Hill & Ponton Disability Attorneys](https://www.hillandponton.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li><li>[Good Calculators](https://goodcalculators.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li><li>[CCK Law](https://cck-law.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li> |
