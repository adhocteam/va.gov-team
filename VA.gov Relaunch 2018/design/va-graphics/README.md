# VA Graphics Standards and Assets

The VA graphics standards guide and graphic assets come from https://vaww.va.gov/6102/index.asp (you must be on the VA network with a PIV card to access). While many of these standards are outdated and mostly for a print world, many of the rules still apply for web.

Here are some examples of more modern VA subsites that use the U.S. Web Design System and modern takes of VA grpahics:
