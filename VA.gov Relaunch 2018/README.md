# VA.gov Relaunch 2018
On Veterans Day of 2018 (11/8/18), VA.gov was relaunched with a consolidation of the various VA.gov digital properties (MHV, eBenefits, Vets.gov). This folder contains the historical documentation for planning and executing that relaunch.

*Note*: In this directory you'll come across the word '**Merger**' and the acronym '**WBC**' (Web Brand Consolidation). Both are referring to the VA.gov relaunch.
