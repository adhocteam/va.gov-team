<p class="va-introtext">
With VA health care, you’re covered for regular checkups with your primary care provider and appointments with specialists (like cardiologists, gynecologists, and mental health providers). You also gain access to home health and geriatric (elder) care, medical equipment, prosthetics, and prescriptions.
</p>

Veterans may call (202) 745-8685 to make appointments at the clinic.

The clinic is located in the Southeast Veterans Service Center near the intersection of Chesapeake Street and Southern Avenue in Southeast Washington. It is easily accessible by Metrobus routes A6 (Anacostia-Congress Heights Line) and P12 (Eastover-Addison Road Line). The Anacostia subway station is on the A6 route, and the Addison Road subway station is on the P12 route.

Dr. Robin Peck provides comprehensive Women's health care.
