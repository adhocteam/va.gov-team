# Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP)
The `va.gov-team` repository is used for documentation created and used by the teams that build and use the VSP. The information in this repo is relevant to teams building Veteran-facing services, teams running the platform itself, DSVA (Digital Service at VA), DEPO (Digital Experience Product Office) team members, and VA stakeholders.

This repo is open and available to the public.

### What is the VSP?
The Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, a design system based on the U.S. Web Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.
