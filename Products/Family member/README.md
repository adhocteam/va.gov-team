# Family member
Welcome to the Family member hub. In this directory, you'll find lots of information about the Veteran-facing services and applications that fall under the Family member category.

**The Family member hub does not currently exist on VA.gov.** Research and discovery is being done to determine the best approach for including this information on VA.gov.

Browse through the product folders to find all the details, background, contacts, and status of all the Family member tools. 

Product Managers are responsible for keeping these directories up-to-date and well-organized. If you have a question and can't find the answer, don't hesitate to send a message to the #vfs-product channel in Slack.
