## Content writing and plain language best practices

When creating content for VA.gov, all teams building on the Veteran Services Platform are required to adhere to VA.gov content and design system styleguides. This ensures we speak in one voice and create a consistent, clear, and positive experience for Veterans and their family members.

## General standards
In addition adhering to the content and design styleguides above, please follow the below standards:   

1. Use plain language and write for your audience. Use language that the user feels comfortable with and will understand. 

Plain language uses: 
-	Common, recognizable words that often have fewer syllables than their more complex synonyms (“help” rather than “assistance” and "happen" rather than "occur")
-	Contractions (“don’t” rather than “do not”)
-	Active rather than passive voice
-	Shorter sentences and paragraphs
-	Bulleted lists and bolded subheads to organize or “chunk” content in a scannable way
-	A conversational style, with questions in the first person (i.e., "How can I get these benefits?") and answers in the second person (i.e., "You'll need to apply for benefits").

2. Use words consistently to inspire trust and provide a consistent user experience across VA.gov. 

For example, form introduction pages and VA.gov How to Apply pages use repeatable language and design elements on the page.  This ensures that users will have a consistent and familiar experience across all forms when applying for a benefit online.
show examples: 
How to apply pages use the eligibility blue box and header 


3. Make the writing conversational 
Use everyday words and pronouns to speak to the user.  Use “you” to address the user and help them understand what they need to do. Please avoid using “he” and “she.” 
For example: 

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

**Active voice:** Local organizations run most homeless services.

**Active voice:** You can appeal any decision VA makes about your benefits.


</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

**Passive voice:** Most homeless services are run locally.	

**Passive voice:** All benefits decisions can be appealed.	
</div>
</div>


4. Organize content in clear and scannable “chunks.”

Break down complex information so it's easy for the user to understand and digest the information. This helps guide users through the information step by step without overwhelming them.  Keep sentences and paragraphs short:	Aim for sentences that have only 1 main message. 


5. Be empathetic

Talk person-to-person to our users. Use language that puts the person first (not the disability, benefit, age, or race)
Don't put the label before the person.

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
policyholders who are disabled and terminally ill

women Veterans who are homeless

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
disabled and terminally ill policyholders	

homeless women Veterans	

</div>
</div>


6. When incorporating feedback from user research sessions and call center data be sure it aligns with VA.gov voice, style, and tone. 


**Note:** Veterans aren’t the only ones visiting VA.gov — their spouses, children, and other family members may also be looking for information about VA benefits and services. Consider defining military or VA terms that may be familiar to Veterans, but not to their dependents.
If a definition is short, put it in parentheses next to the word it defines, for example: "If you don’t agree with the VBA’s decision, you can appeal to the Board for a de novo (new look) review."

If a definition is long, define the word in a separate sentence, for example: "If you can’t work because of a service-connected disability, you may be able to get the same benefits as a 100% disabled Veteran, regardless of your rating. This is called being individually unemployable."

## What to expect in a content review

During a review, the content will be reviewed to ensure it aligns with our plain language best practices and VA.gov design system and content guidelines. The goal is that we present a consistent message, tone, and voice across the platform and the overall VA.gov ecosystem. 
During a content review, the following will be assessed: 
-	[ ] Voice: Does the content balance the voice between friendly and formal and sounds approachable and supportive? The VA.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications and is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human.

-	[ ] Tone: Does the content come across as harsh or intimidating? Even when discussing a serious topic, the tone should be gentle and compassionate. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state.

-	[ ] Plain language best practices: Is the content written in active voice and present tense? Ensure that the content isn’t too “wordy” or uses excessive modifying words (e.g, “really, completely, totally,” etc.)

-	[ ] Grammar and style guide check: The review will also include a grammar check to make sure the content doesn’t contain typos, misspellings, and spacing errors. Review will also ensure that the content adheres to the VA style guide.

## How to request a content review

1. Open a Zenhub issue in ```va.gov-team repo```.
2. Choose standard issue template. 
3. Title for the issue: ```Request Content review: [title of tool/app/page]```

4. Be sure to include the following in the issue: 

**User story**

As a _____, I need _____ so I can _____.

*As a member of a team building with or on VSP, I need to my content reviewed before [a usability session or product launch] to ensure it's accurate, aligns with VA style and error-free.*

**Goal** 

 Please include: 
-	The content for review. If short, drop the text directly into the issue. For longer content, you could include:

        * Word document
        * link to a high-fidelity prototype
        * link to the URL where the content appears on staging
        
-	Context. Provide a high-level description of where the content will appear. Is it part of a tool or static page that will support a tool? It's helpful to include screenshots of where the content will appear. 
-	Design elements to consider. This applies for content that isn't formatted yet. Will this content appear as a tooltip, alert box, error message, new application or tool?. 
-	User research. Is there any specific information from user research to take into consideration when doing the content review? 

**Acceptance criteria**

Please list a specific timeframe for when this content should be reviewed. (For example, is the content for an upcoming user testing session? Is it part of an upcoming product launch?)

**Depending on the complexity and amount of content, content review will be completed within 4 days.** 

Please also tag the issue with:

-	Milestone (when do you want this completed?)
-	Epic (what body of work is this a part of?)
-	Team/Practice Area label  ( ```content``` or ```content-ia-team```)
-	Assign issue to @peggygannon

5. Once the content review is complete:
The reviewer will update the Zenhub issue with a Word document (with changes tracked) to show where content needs to be changed.
If your team has questions (or disagrees with a requested change), use the Zenhub issue to discuss those questions.

6. When all changes are completed, close the issue.
