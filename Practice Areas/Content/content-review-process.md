## Content writing and plain language best practices

When creating content for VA.gov, write in plain language and follow writing guidelines according to the VA.gov content and design system styleguides. This ensures we speak in one voice and create a consistent, clear, and positive experience for Veterans and their family members.

In addition to the style guidelines above, please take into account the following when writing content: 

1. Use plain language and write for your audience. Use language that the user feels comfortable with and will understand. 
Plain language uses: 

-	Common, recognizable words that often have fewer syllables than their more complex synonyms (“help” rather than “assistance” and "happen" rather than "occur")
-	Contractions (“don’t” rather than “do not”)
-	Active rather than passive voice
-	Shorter sentences and paragraphs
-	Bulleted lists and bolded subheads to organize or “chunk” content in a scannable way
-	A conversational style, with questions in the first person (i.e., "How can I get these benefits?") and answers in the second person (i.e., "You'll need to apply for benefits").

2. Use words consistently to inspire trust and provide a consistent user experience across VA.gov. 
For example, form introduction pages and VA.gov How to Apply pages use repeatable language and design elements on the page.  This ensures that users will have a consistent and familiar experience across form when applying for a benefit online.
show examples: 
How to apply pages use the eligibility blue box and header 



3. Make the writing conversational 
Use everyday words and pronouns to speak to the user. Make the content relevant to them by writing in active voice and present tense.  Use “you” to address the user and help them understand what they need to do. Please avoid using “he” and “she.” 
For example: 

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

**Active voice:** Local organizations run most homeless services.

**Active voice:** You can appeal any decision VA makes about your benefits.


</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

**Passive voice:** Most homeless services are run locally.	

**Passive voice:** All benefits decisions can be appealed.	
</div>
</div>


4. Organize content in clear and scannable “chunks.”

Break down complex information so it's easy for the user to understand and digest the information. It also helps guide them through the information step by step without overwhelming them.  Keep sentences and paragraphs short.

-	Aim for sentences that are 15 words or fewer, but know that longer sentences are sometimes necessary.
-	Aim for sentences that have only 1 main message. Use simple sentence construction and consider what information really needs to be included.

5. Be empathetic

Talk person-to-person to our users. Use language that puts the person first (not the disability, benefit, age, or race)
Don't put the label before the person	Use person-first language

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
policyholders who are disabled and terminally ill

women Veterans who are homeless

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
disabled and terminally ill policyholders	

homeless women Veterans	

</div>
</div>


6. When incorporating feedback from user research sessions and call center data be sure it aligns with VA.gov voice, style, and tone. 


**Note:** Veterans aren’t the only ones visiting VA.gov — their spouses, children, and other family members may also be looking for information about VA benefits and services. Consider defining military or VA terms that may be familiar to Veterans, but not to their dependents.
If a definition is short, put it in parentheses next to the word it defines, for example: "If you don’t agree with the VBA’s decision, you can appeal to the Board for a de novo (new look) review."

If a definition is long, define the word in a separate sentence, for example: "If you can’t work because of a service-connected disability, you may be able to get the same benefits as a 100% disabled Veteran, regardless of your rating. This is called being individually unemployable."

## What to expect in a content review

During a review, the content will be reviewed to ensure it aligns with our plain language best practices and VA.gov design system and content guidelines. The goal is that we present a consistent message, tone, and voice across the platform and the overall VA.gov ecosystem. 
During a content review, the following will be assessed: 
-	[ ] Voice: Does the content balance the voice between friendly and formal and sounds approachable and supportive? The VA.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications and is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human.

-	[ ] Tone: Does the content come across as harsh or intimidating? Even when discussing a serious topic, the tone should be gentle and compassionate. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state.

-	[ ] Plain language best practices: Is the content written in active voice and present tense? Ensure that the content isn’t too “wordy” or uses excessive modifying words (e.g, “really, completely, totally,” etc.)

-	[ ] Grammar check: The review will also include a grammar check to make sure the content doesn’t contain typos, misspellings, and punctuation errors.

## How to request a content review

Open a Zenhub issue. Choose standard issue template, and be sure to include the following: 

**User story**

As a _____, I need _____ so I can _____.

*As a member of a team building with or on VSP, I need to my content reviewed before [usability sessions or product launch] to ensure it's accurate, aligns with VA style and error-free.*

**Goal** 

 Please include: 
-	The content that needs to be reviewed (If short, drop the text into the issue, or attach a Word document or high-fidelity prototype to the issue with the content)
-	Context on where the content will appear. Is it part of a tool or static page? Is it a new application or a static page that will support an application? It's helpful to include screensshots of where the content will appear. 
-	Any specific design elements to consider? (for example, will this content appear as a tooltip, alert box, error message, new application or tool?)
-	 What are we trying to convey to our users with this content? Is there any specific information from user research to consider when reviewing the content? 

**Acceptance criteria**

Please list a specific timeframe for when this content should be reviewed. (For example, is the content for an upcoming user testing session? Is it part of an upcoming product release? When should the content be deployed?)
Depending on the complexity or amount of content, the typical content review turnaround time is 2 days. 


**Please also tag the issue with:**

-	Milestone (when do you want this be completed?)
-	Epic (what body of work is this a part of?)
-	Team/Practice Area label  (content or content-ia-team)
-	Assign issue to @peggygannon
