  - Sometimes uses the messaging system
- Would you typically use your phone or computer?

### Task 1
Ok, let’s take a look at one option for the design.

#### Homepage option: Top tasks
- What do you think of this page?
  - "It's fine, gets you everything you need."
- What do you think of the look and feel?
  - "It's fine. I think, for a site like yours, all they want to do is get there and 'I want the quickest route without having to go through 15 screens to get my prescriptions.' "
  - Indicates that colors doesn't matter over the information and "the architecture of getting the customer to what they need from the front page"
  - "Don't care about your colors or anything like that"
  - "The problem is...you've got older people trying to use this. They want something simple."
  - Thinks the homepage design is "too small"
  - An older person like his dad wants to see a big prescription symbol
  - He likes the current large links / icons on MyHealtheVet
-	Where would you go first?
  - Refill prescription
- What do you like about this page?
  - It gets your right there on the top of it.
  - People like pictures -- they want to see a picture of a prescription. Show a file for their files.
- What don't you like about this page?
  - Need more and bigger icons for the main features that are going to be used
  - "If I have to scroll down, I'm not even going to look at it. You need your main features up front"
  - Focus on one-click access to the things people want
- How well does this page meet your needs?
  - As long as I can click on 'Refill your prescription' and it works, then this is fine
  - Doesn't like the back-end of the refill prescription tool

### Task 2
Ok, let’s take a look at one option for the design.

#### Homepage option: Benefit category
- What do you think of this page?
  -"Same as that one."
  - "As long as you can click on one thing and go straight to the page" than it's fine
  - Referenced top tasks as the most important information to put at the top
  - Did not mention anything about organizing by category
- What do you think of the look and feel?
  - "It's fine -- again."
-	Where would you go first?
  - "Prescriptions, becuase that's what I use the site for." (Found this quickly and easily) 
  - Referenced top tasks again, and not having to scroll down the page
- What do you like about this page?
  - "It's fine as it is."
- What don't you like about this page?
- How well does this page meet your needs?
  - Yes, because refill prescrptions is at the top
  - Suggested putting the secondary CTAs from top taks design to the top right of zone 1
  
### Post-Tasks Interview
Thanks for taking a look at those designs. We have two follow up questions.

-	How did those pages compare to your past experience with VA?
  - It's "hellish" to go through the experience of finding and applying for benefits
  - Registering for websites and upgrading to premium accounts is a bad experience and requires people having to call the halp center to complete certain tasks
  - He is disastisfied with the log in experience
-	What else can we do to make your online experience better?
  - Registration requirements to use all the features is a "horrible experience"

**Overall preference: Top tasks design**

### Warm-up Questions (Optional)
Before we look at new design, could you please tell us
- What are the top 2 or 3 reasons you would visit a VA website?
  - The biggest right now is eBenefits, because everything for an Active Duty person going into Veteran status is there
  - The VA website "is the most confusing I've seen in awhile"
  - If you can't do it in three mouse clicks...
  - If you have to keep scrolling until you get to the bottom of the screen...
  - "The individuals using the site are not millenials." Most users are Korean and Vietnam and Golf War Veterans, and they are trying to navigate a system that is difficult
  - VA.gov and eBenefits are both "incredibly difficult to use"
  - Why can't we get a CAC card and readers for Veterans to get into the websites? He's worried about having to create new accounts and remember passwords
  - "I would love to have a CAC card to go right ot my appointment, right to the functionality."
  - The VA government platform / website is about 20 years out of sync
  - "Who still scrolls?"
- Would you typically use your phone or computer?
  - Both phone and laptop

  - "I love it."
  - "If you look at the website now -- holy shit."
  - He's looking to update his personal information, like his address. He couldn't find it on VA.gov, and can't find it in this design.
  - He focused only on above the fold content
- What do you think of the look and feel?
-	Where would you go first?
  - When going to other sites, he looks for his personal information first
  - "I'm assuming that if you're signed in (he pointed to the sign in button in the header)."
  - He's looking for a 'manage your profile' link or sign in CTA in zone 1
  - Apply for new benefits doesn't really apply because he's active duty right now
  - He agrees with the order of the four top tasks lists
- What do you like about this page?
  - "I like how clean it is."
- What don't you like about this page?
  - Expand the box and make the font bigger
  - Start with step one -- log in or CAC card
- How well does this page meet your needs?
  - "Absolutely."
  - "My two things are three mouse clicks and you're there, and CAC card log in."
  - "Make it larger for the old guys."

### Task 2
Ok, let’s take a look at one option for the design.

#### Homepage option: Benefit category
- What do you think of this page?
  - "It's very busy."
  - "This looks a lot like the old site, except the boxes are more defined. Very busy."
  - In ten years, he says he woudl look at this design and "get lost"
- What do you think of the look and feel?
-	Where would you go first?
  - "It's a lot easier to go to this one" (pointing at the top tasks design)
  - "Apply for health care -- you're going to do that one time" and you're not going to need it anymore
- What do you like about this page?
  - "Not a lot."
  - He likes the Veteran Success Story
  - This particulary website is confusing. The four box is simpler and easier (top tasks design).
- What don't you like about this page?
- How well does this page meet your needs?
  - If you want time to look through, then the benefit category design is good
  - If time is of the essence, then the top tasks design is good

### Post-Tasks Interview
Thanks for taking a look at those designs. We have two follow up questions.

-	How did those pages compare to your past experience with VA?
  - Both of these are better than what's currently built
  - "The eBenefits one is a complete and utter disaster."
  - "The MyHealtheVet is a disaster in and of itself."
  - "The sites are a disaster right now."
-	What else can we do to make your online experience better?
  - The biggest thing is the CAC card, but they are expensive and you need card readers and software. But it would be so easy for the Veteran.
  - "These guys have been through hell." They last thing they need is trouble navigating the system.
  - There's still a heavy reliance to contact the VA by phone, especially for older Veterans
  - "The DS Log On is a true pain in the ass." The password times out every 90 days and there are strict character requirements.
  - "I hope this one materializes for you" (pointing to top tasks design)
  - "I see a lot of redundancy." Referencing Vets.gov, he's not sure what it's trying to do, since he goes directly to eBenefits and MyHealtheVet.
