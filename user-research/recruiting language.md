Hello! My name is Natalie and I'm on a team at VA building new online tools for Veterans to access their benefits. Our goal is to talk with Veterans before, during, and after creating these new online tools to make sure we get it right. You can help us by completing a quick online card-sorting activity. This activity is fun and only takes about 10-15 minutes to complete! Use the link below to get started. This is your chance to shape online services that will help millions of Veterans!
