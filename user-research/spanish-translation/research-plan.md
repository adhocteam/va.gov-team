//Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]

What product & team are you doing this research for?
Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the 

**Goals**

* To provide English-as-a-second-language (ESL) or limited-English-proficiency (LEP) Veterans, beneficiaries, or caregivers access to plain language, single source of truth, benefits content, so they have equal access to the benefits they have earned.   
* To meet federal/agency requirements for providing translated benefit information.   
* IA - To determine the best way to present Spanish language materials: 
    1. Most important information - most necessary, most visited, most searched, etc. 
    2. Best way to navigate to translated content.   
* Figure out needed resources - Necessary budget, contracting resources to get these translations done, reviewed and shipped.   
* Create archetypes of who our users, are as we continue to provide translated content for their needs. 

**Research questions**

TBD

**Method**

The first round of research can be done remotely using tools like zoom, appear.in or google hangouts.

**Contextual inquiry and ethnographic questions** 

To understand more who our user are, further develop archetypes, understand user needs and priorities.

**Card sorting** 

To test out content hierarchy

**Guided inquiry about the following topics using mock ups**
* VA.gov content 
* Iterations of the va.com structure, ways to find translated content
* Other resources online and offline where then find VA information and services
* All other resources they may use

**What will you be testing?**

* Existing VA.gov Content
* VA.gov content re arranged in different navigation structures.
* Hierarchy of content.

**Participants and Recruitment**
Veterans and veteran family members and caregivers who are monolingual and speak Spanish, or are bilingual and prefer to read content in Spanish.

**What is your recruitment strategy?**
I would user social media and veteran service organizations to find users.
* Minority Veterans of America 
* American GI Forum 
* FB groups of Veterans in Spanish 

Without having the actual date on the number of Veteran populations, these are the U.S. regions with greater Spanish speaking populations:
* Puerto Rico 
* Southern California 
* New York, New Jersey, Long Island 
* Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach FL 
* Texas 
* Bay Area CA 
* Washington DC Metro Are 
* Chicago IL 


**When?**

We can start talking to users the week of May 13 but dates are flexible

**Number of Users**

Around 30 users, preferable 10 of the following groups 
Veterans
Family members who need to request benefits
Caregivers.

**Length of Sessions** 

My guesstimate is:
30 min Ethnographic questions
30 min UI/Web questions
30 wrap-up
1:30 hour per user - I like to use a half hr in between users to translate feedback into notes - but also flexible

**Availability**

Week of 5/12 - 5/17
Week of 5/20 - 5/25

**Pilot**

Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
