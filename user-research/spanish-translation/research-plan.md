//Research Plan for VA.gov website team & VBA / Benefits hub localization (Spanish, Tagalog) / May 2, 2019

### What product & team are you doing this research for?

VA.gov website team & VBA / Benefits hub localization (Spanish, Tagalog)

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product?  

We want to provide Spanish and Tagolog translations of new VA.gov benefits content and an easy, simple way to access translated content. 

**Goals of research**
To determine the best way for users to navigate to Spanish language benefits content. 
    1. Where should we link people to localized content in a way that's visible but not disruptive? 
    2. How should we link people to localized content in a way that's visible but not disruptive? 
    3. Will people be able to navigate around/between source English and localized content without getting lost? 
    
* Create archetypes of who our users are, as we continue to provide translated content for their needs.

**Research questions**

TBD

**Method**

The first round of research can be done remotely using tools like Zoom, Appear.in or Google Hangouts.

**Guided inquiry about the following topics using mockups**
We will focus on the top 3-5 topic pages which currently get the most organic search traffic for translated content: 
benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/pension_veteran.asp
benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/homeloans_purchaseco_certificate.asp
benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/compensation_types.asp
benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/homeloans_purchaseco_eligbility.asp
benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/compensation_types-disability.asp

We will test navigation on and to mock Spanish translated pages for these English source pages: 

**Home loans**

**What will you be testing?**
We will test navigation to and from Spanish pages for 2 benefit sections, home loans and pensions, 3 pagess in each section. 


**Participants and recruitment**
Veterans and veteran family members and caregivers who are monolingual and speak Spanish, or are bilingual and prefer to read content in Spanish.

**What is your recruitment strategy?**
I would user social media and veteran service organizations to find users. [My HealtheVet email?]
* Minority Veterans of America
* American GI Forum
* FB groups of Veterans in Spanish
* Other resource that Sandy Tadeo in VBA may recommend [TBD]

Without having the actual date on the number of Veteran populations, these are the U.S. regions with greater Spanish speaking populations:
* Puerto Rico
* Southern California 
* New York, New Jersey, Long Island
* Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach FL
* Texas
* Bay Area CA
* Washington DC Metro Area
* Chicago IL


**When?**

We can start talking to users the week of May 13 but dates are flexible.

**Number of users**

Around 30 users, preferable 10 each of the following groups 
- Veterans
- Family members who need to request benefits
- Caregivers

**Length of sessions** 

Approximately:
30 min ethnographic questions
30 min UI/Web questions
30 wrap-up
1:30 hour per user - I like to use a half hr in between users to translate feedback into notes - but also flexible [@Carola - do you mean 30 min of wrap-up WITH THE SUBJECT or as wrap-up time for moderator before next session?  Either way sounds fine, just wanted to understand, so I can clarify the language.]

Week of 5/20 - 5/25

**Pilot**

Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? [@Carola/@Lauren - not sure what this means - piloting the research before the research? Does this mean, do a rehearsal with??]
