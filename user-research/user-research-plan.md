# User Research Plan - for merger work

*Note: In the ever present debate about the need for formative vs summative user research, we are leveraging the research done to create the various websites (vets.gov, explore.va.gov, MHV, etc) as the formative stage. We are focused on evaluating and validating key questions and prototypes to move the merger project forward.*
